			Extent of occurrence estimated to be less than 20,000 km2 or area of occupancy estimated to be less than 2000 km2<br>
			A vulnerable species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as likely to become endangered unless the circumstances 
			that are threatening its survival and reproduction improve.

Vulnerability is mainly caused by habitat loss or destruction of the species home. Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened. Some species listed as "vulnerable" may be common in captivity, an example being the military macaw.
